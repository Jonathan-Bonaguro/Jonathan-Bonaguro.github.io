      <title>Jonathan Bonaguro: Photographer for Hire</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;everyone-has-a-hidden-talent-most-people-dont-know-that-i-work-as-a-freelance-photographer&#34;&gt;Everyone has a hidden talent. Most people don&amp;rsquo;t know that I work as a freelance photographer.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve shot headshots, concerts, weddings, and studio portraits. For newspapers, I&amp;rsquo;ve covered sports, feature stories, and breaking news. I spent the summer in 2019 traveling across the country with The Cavaliers Drum &amp;amp; Bugle Corps documenting the life of one of the nations most storied and successful drum corps. I&amp;rsquo;ve done a little bit of it all, and I hope to keep expanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-brief-timeline&#34;&gt;A brief timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents got me my first camera for Christmas in 2015. I had asked for one after experimenting with my parent&amp;rsquo;s Canon Rebel t1i. I thought I would use it a lot, and like a lot of things we try, it turns out I never did. My little Canon 70D sat in a closet for a couple years until the spring of 2018 when a good friend of mine asked me to cover some baseball games for a blog he wrote. My first baseball game was cold and rainy, and I bundled up tight and stuck my camera in a plastic bag to try and protect it. Since that first game, photography has become an integral part of my life and I love the ability to share everyone&amp;rsquo;s story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the first year shooting sports casually for that same blog. At the end of my Junior year of college, I was asked to take over the sports photography department at the campus paper, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dailyillini.com/&#34;&gt;The Daily Illini&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after, I was asked by the director of the Marching Illini to take over as his Media &amp;amp; Public Relations manager for the 2020 season, serving both as principal photographer and head of media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-ive-done&#34;&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;ve done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;editorial&#34;&gt;Editorial&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sports photography is my primary passion. I love the energy and excitement that comes with shooting sports. The challenge of capturing the perfect moment in the heat of the moment is one that every photographer aspires to. For various outlets, I have covered pretty much every collegiate sports including football, basektball, volleyball, baseball, softball, and cross country. I provide high quality, captioned images on tight deadlines to meet the needs of online and print newspapers. I&amp;rsquo;ve covered sports for blogs like The Champaign Room as well as newspapers such as The Daily Illini and The News-Gazette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although not as frequently, I also cover other editorial photography. I have worked with reporters on feature stories as well as covering breaking news in both Champaign-Urbana and back in my hometown of Naperville, Illinois. Being able to capture images that tell a compelling story of the way the world is and what is going on is my goal. I want readers to be able to feel like they were at an event by conveying strong emotions through my images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;pageantry-arts&#34;&gt;Pageantry Arts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a band nerd all my life, I also have a lot of experience shooting bands. After spending three years in the nation&amp;rsquo;s premier college marching band, the Marching Illini, I served as their photographer for the 2020 season. This included spending all of their preseason camp documenting the journey of prospective members, spending game-days documenting the experience of the band from 7:00am rehearsals all the way through their post game concert. I was with them for many events including the Homecoming Parade and Concert, MI in Concert, and the Redbox Bowl in Santa Clara, California. My experience as a performer made me a natural fit for the band, as I took that experience and turned it into my images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the summer of 2019 travling with The Cavaliers Drum &amp;amp; Bugle Corps as their chief photographer. With a team of two other photographers, I set the creative direction of a team that captured dynamic and captivating images for promotional and social media use for a ~$5 million dollar non-profit organization. I told the corps story by becoming nearly an integrated member of the corps. We traveled by tour buses late at night and slept in high school gyms and classrooms. Every day from late May through early August I was telling the story of competitive marching arts through captivating imagry, and I learned a lot about working with a creative team and how to manage and learn from and incorporate feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;miscellaneous&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like any other photographer, I pride myself on being flexbile. Although my primary work has been in sport and editorial work, I am more than happy to work with anyone on any project! I&amp;rsquo;ve shot portraits, headshots, weddings, and other events. Do you know a person who needs a fresh LinkedIn picture or just some more recent shots? Are you a business lookig to market some products? I&amp;rsquo;m more than happy to talk to you. Visit the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jonathan-bonaguro.github.io/#contact&#34;&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; portion of my website to connect with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;follow-your-passions&#34;&gt;Follow your Passions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love my day job. Working as a researcher in a social science research firm truly is my passion, and I hope someday to earn my Ph. D. and continue work on event data. However, photography will always be a significant portion of my life. Having a hobby that I am passionate about not only makes me a happier, more rounded human being, but I find that it makes me more productive in my day job too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;work-with-me&#34;&gt;Work with me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to see more? I have a limited selection of my work available on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/thewanderingbonaguro/&#34;&gt;Instagram Page&lt;/a&gt;, and I am happy to share more upon request.

      <title>Making Friends and Influencing People</title>
      <link>/blog/senior_thesis/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;making-friends-and-influencing-people-the-effect-of-social-media-on-political-knowledge-overconfidence&#34;&gt;Making Friends and Influencing People: The Effect of Social Media on Political Knowledge Overconfidence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 2019-2020 academic year I am undertaking the process of writing a senior thesis. In the fall semester, I took part in a Senior Thesis methodology survey, where the undergraduate honors cohort learned the ins and outs of reserach design and began developing our theses. During the spring semester, I developed my research design and am currently waiting on IRB approval to run my survey. Here&amp;rsquo;s a little bit more information about this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fall-2019&#34;&gt;Fall 2019&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS 495:&lt;/strong&gt; Provides an advanced overview of methodological issues in political science especially identification of research questions and design of research strategies in political science appropriate for a senior thesis. Requires completion of a substantial research proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2019-2020 honors cohort spent the fall of 2019 studying research methods and design under the direction of Professor &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/mswinters1/home&#34;&gt;Matt Winters&lt;/a&gt;. We discussed topics such as the philosophy of science, formulating reserach questions and hypotheses, and the gold standards of reserach design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research focuses on the effect of social media networks on political knowledge overconfidence. Do our friends inadvertently cause us to think we know more than we do? Although more and more people say that they are using Facebook to gather news, &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;most users find news while on Facebook for other reasons and don&amp;rsquo;t actually follow a news organization.&lt;/a&gt; It turns out, people see news on Facebook mostly when it is &lt;a href=&#34;10.1177/2053168018816189&#34;&gt;shared by their friends.&lt;/a&gt; Not only do Facebook users mostly see content when it is shared by their friends, the &lt;a href=&#34;10.1111/0022-3816.00033&#34;&gt;friends they trust to share accurate information&lt;/a&gt; can lead a person to be &lt;a href=&#34;10.1177/2053168018816189&#34;&gt;overconfident in their level of political knowledge.&lt;/a&gt; My research asks if the type of friend who shares political news can affect levels of overconfidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spring-2020&#34;&gt;Spring 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this process, we were asked to locate advisors for our thesis. My advisor is Professor &lt;a href=&#34;https://clinecenter.illinois.edu/people/salthaus&#34;&gt;Scott Althaus&lt;/a&gt;, who&amp;rsquo;s research focuses on political communication. With his guidance, I designed an experiment to test the effect of classes of friends sharing political content and their effect on levels of political knowledge. This reserach is ongoing, and the final thesis will be available in early May. My reserach has also been accepted for presentation at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://undergradresearch.illinois.edu/symposium.html&#34;&gt;Illinois Undergraduate Research Symposium&lt;/a&gt; where I will be presenting a post on April 30, 2020 in the Illini Union. Please reach out before then if you have any questions about my reserach by visiting my &lt;a href=&#34;https://jonathan-bonaguro.github.io/#contact&#34;&gt;contact widget.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
