&lt;h1&gt;STAT 385: One Course to help Synthesize my Expeiences with R&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-course&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Course&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;University Course Catalog Course Description:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statisticians must be savvy in programming methods useful to the wide variety of analysis that they will be expected to perform. This course provides the foundation for writing and packaging statistical algorithms through the creation of functions and object oriented programming. Fundamental programming techniques and considerations will be emphasized. Students will also create dynamic reports that encapsulate their implemented algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course is instructed by the fantastic &lt;a href=&#34;https://hknguyen.org/index.html&#34;&gt;Ha Khanh Nguyen&lt;/a&gt;, visiting instructor and a data science support specialist for the Department of Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;my-history-with-r&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My History with R&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to take STAT385 in my final semester at Illinois to help solidify my knowledge and abilities with R. My experience with R started in &lt;a href=&#34;https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2017/spring/PS/230&#34;&gt;PS 230&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jakebowers.org/&#34;&gt;Professor Jake Bowers&lt;/a&gt;. We were introduced to a lot of things in R, and took a deep dive very quickly into data wrangling, manipulation, and regression. Frankly, I didn’t learn a ton. I was confused most of the semester, but I loved what I was experiencing. Growing up with a software architect for a father I sort of “rebelled” by deciding to pursue a liberal arts degree, but the second I was introduced to coding I was hooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That summer, I ended up working for Professor Bowers and &lt;a href=&#34;http://carawong.org/&#34;&gt;Professor Cara Wong&lt;/a&gt; assisting with data wrangling and modeling. Fortunately they were very patient with me, because I really was in over my head. I Googled a lot of code and did the best I could. I was soon hired by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://clinecenter.illinois.edu/&#34;&gt;Cline Center for Advanced Social Reserach&lt;/a&gt; and have been working there ever on quantitative social science ver since (read more about my experiences at the Cline Center &lt;a href=&#34;https://jonathan-bonaguro.github.io/blog/cline_center/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. After googling enough code to write a few papers, I decided I needed to more firmly ground myself in the methodology. After taking a few calculus and statistics courses, I felt ready to ground myself in R, which lead me to STAT 385. In the Fall of 2018 I took &lt;a href=&#34;https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2018/fall/IS/457&#34;&gt;IS 457&lt;/a&gt;, which blew past all of the general information and went quickly to modeling, visualization, and some more advanced feature of R. This experience showed me that I needed a bit more time with the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-ive-learned&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What I’ve Learned&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course has been great for showing me the proper way to do a lot of basic things in R, and reinforcing the concepts so I don’t feel like I have to google simple things like subsetting and data manipulation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important note:&lt;/strong&gt; this blog post is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; meant to be a comprehensive introduction to R. This is simply a brief synopsis of what I’ve learned during the first half of the semester in STAT 385. There are a bunch of great resources for learning R, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/&#34;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; by RStudio educator &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/garrett-grolemund-49328411/&#34;&gt;Garrett Grolemund&lt;/a&gt;. For a comprehensive collection of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; lecture notes for this course, please visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Jonathan-Bonaguro/R-GENERAL/tree/master/STAT385&#34;&gt;my STAT 385 Github Repository.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;data-types-in-r&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data Types in R&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to gloss over information regarding the R user interface and basic interaction. This was information I was already familiar with, and plenty of tutorials can be found online. After that introduction, one of the first things we covered was data types that R works with. A lot of this information I already knew, but it was a good refreshed having it all laid out again. We covered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;vectors&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Vectors&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomic vectors only store one type of data, and the function &lt;code&gt;c()&lt;/code&gt; concatenates a vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Double Vectors
die &amp;lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
die
## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6

typeof(die)
## [1] &amp;quot;double&amp;quot;

## Any number is stored as a double vector of length 1
typeof(4.5)
## [1] &amp;quot;double&amp;quot;

# Integer vectors denoted by &amp;#39;L&amp;#39;
my_integer &amp;lt;- c(-1L, 2L, 4L)
my_integer
## [1] -1  2  4

typeof(my_integer)
## [1] &amp;quot;integer&amp;quot;

# Character Vectors
text &amp;lt;- c(&amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot;, &amp;#39;World&amp;#39;)
text
## [1] &amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot; &amp;quot;World&amp;quot;

typeof(text)
## [1] &amp;quot;character&amp;quot;

# Logical Vectors
my_logic &amp;lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
my_logic
## [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE

typeof(my_logic)
## [1] &amp;quot;logical&amp;quot;

# Complex Vectors
my_complex &amp;lt;- complex(real = 1, imaginary = 2)
my_complex
## [1] 1+2i

typeof(my_complex)
## [1] &amp;quot;complex&amp;quot;

# Raw Vectors (bytes of data)
my_raw &amp;lt;- raw(length = 3)
my_raw
## [1] 00 00 00

typeof(my_raw)
## [1] &amp;quot;raw&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also covered indexing items from a vector using &lt;code&gt;[ ]&lt;/code&gt;. The iteration starts at 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;die &amp;lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

die[1]
## [1] 1
die[4]
## [1] 4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;we-also-talked-about-lists&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;We also talked about lists&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lists can group R objects such as vectors and other lists in a one dimensional array! We talked about creating lists using &lt;code&gt;list()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;my_list &amp;lt;- list(1, &amp;quot;one&amp;quot;, TRUE)
my_list
## [[1]]
## [1] 1
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] &amp;quot;one&amp;quot;
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] TRUE

big_list &amp;lt;- list(1:12, &amp;quot;2020&amp;quot;, list(&amp;quot;january&amp;quot;, 2:8))
big_list
## [[1]]
##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] &amp;quot;2020&amp;quot;
## 
## [[3]]
## [[3]][[1]]
## [1] &amp;quot;january&amp;quot;
## 
## [[3]][[2]]
## [1] 2 3 4 5 6 7 8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also talked about how to index lists, using &lt;code&gt;[ ]&lt;/code&gt; which returns lists and &lt;code&gt;[[ ]]&lt;/code&gt; which can be used to return vectors, and how these items in combination can be used to access any item in a list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;big_list[[1]]
##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12

big_list[1]
## [[1]]
##  [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12

big_list[[3]][[1]]
## [1] &amp;quot;january&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;we-talked-briefly-about-matrices-and-arrays&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;We talked briefly about matrices and arrays&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matrices store values of the same data type in a two-dimensional array, and arrays are &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;-dimensional. These are created with the functions &lt;code&gt;matrix()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;array()&lt;/code&gt; Arguments can be specified using &lt;code&gt;nrow =&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ncol =&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;byrow = TRUE&lt;/code&gt;. We also talked about indexing matrices and arrays using &lt;code&gt;[ , ]&lt;/code&gt; for the number of dimensions of the array. For a matrix, the first number is row and the second number is column. Leave one argument blank if you want &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; item in that row or column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;m &amp;lt;- matrix(data = die, nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
m
##      [,1] [,2] [,3]
## [1,]    1    2    3
## [2,]    4    5    6

m[1, 2]
## [1] 2

m[2, ]
## [1] 4 5 6

my_array &amp;lt;- array(data = 1:12, dim = c(2, 2, 3))
my_array

## [2,]   10   12

my_array[ , 1, 1]
## [1] 1 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;data-frames&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Data Frames&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data frames are a list of &lt;strong&gt;vectors of the same length&lt;/strong&gt;. We discussed how to make data frames using &lt;code&gt;data.frame()&lt;/code&gt;, and how to get information about the dataframe using &lt;code&gt;str()&lt;/code&gt;. We also discussed reading data using &lt;code&gt;read.csv()&lt;/code&gt; to make dataframes from .csv files either on our machines or that are online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cards &amp;lt;- data.frame(face = c(&amp;quot;ace&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;two&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;six&amp;quot;),
                    suit = c(&amp;quot;clubs&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;clubs&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;clubs&amp;quot;),
                    value = c(1, 2, 3))
cards
##   face  suit value
## 1  ace clubs     1
## 2  two clubs     2
## 3  six clubs     3

##  $ suit : Factor w/ 1 level &amp;quot;clubs&amp;quot;: 1 1 1
##  $ value: num  1 2 3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also talked about indexing dataframes using &lt;code&gt;[ , ]&lt;/code&gt; and either numbers or logical values. For the sake of brevity in this blog posting, I am not going to provide any examples. I have a LOT of course material to cover!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;functions-if-else-and-loops&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Functions, if else, and loops&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;functions&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Functions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty early on, we talked about writing our own functions using this notation: &lt;code&gt;my_function &amp;lt;- function(arguments) {code}&lt;/code&gt;. A function includes a name, argument, and code to act on the arguments. These can get quite complex, so here’s an example to sum the value of a roll of two dice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;roll_die &amp;lt;- function() {
  die &amp;lt;- 1:6
  dice &amp;lt;- sample(x = die, size = 2, replace = TRUE)
  sum(dice)
}

roll_die()
## [1] 10&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can include arguments to do things like specify the number of dice. To set a default value, make the argument equal to a value in &lt;code&gt;function()&lt;/code&gt;. The first function call will sum the roll of a pair of dice as we did not specify the value, but the second function call will sum the rolls of 10 die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;roll_dice &amp;lt;- function(num_die = 2) {
  die &amp;lt;- 1:6
  dice &amp;lt;- sample(x = die, size = num_die, replace = TRUE)
  sum(dice)
}

roll_dice()
## [1] 7

roll_dice(num_die = 10)
## [1] 31&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;if-and-else-statements&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; statements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement is used to tell R when to do something. If a condition is &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt;, then R will enact the body of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;num &amp;lt;- -2

if (num &amp;lt; 0) {
  num &amp;lt;- num * -1
}

num
## [1] 2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the condition is not satisfied, nothing happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;num &amp;lt;- 4

if (num &amp;lt; 0) {
  num &amp;lt;- num * -1
}

num
## [1] 4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; statements are used for when a condition is &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;a &amp;lt;- 3.15

decimal &amp;lt;- a - trunc(a)
decimal
## [1] 0.15

if (decimal &amp;gt;= 0.5) {
  a &amp;lt;- trunc(a) + 1
} else {
  a &amp;lt;- trunc(a)
}

a
## [1] 3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;loops&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Loops&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few different types of loops in R. &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops repeats a chunk of code, once for each element in the input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;for (value in c(&amp;quot;My&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;second&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;for&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;loop&amp;quot;)) {
  print(value)
}
## [1] &amp;quot;My&amp;quot;
## [1] &amp;quot;second&amp;quot;
## [1] &amp;quot;for&amp;quot;
## [1] &amp;quot;loop&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop executes code while the condition remains true. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cash &amp;lt;- 20
n &amp;lt;- 0

while (cash &amp;gt; 0) {
  cash &amp;lt;- cash - 1
  n &amp;lt;- n + 1
}

n
## [1] 20&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;repeat&lt;/code&gt; loop executes until it hits a &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; statement or you tell it stop by hitting &lt;code&gt;esc&lt;/code&gt;. Again, for brevity, no example is included. However, examples can be found in my STAT385 lecture notes on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Jonathan-Bonaguro/R-GENERAL/tree/master/STAT385/Lecture%20Notes&#34;&gt;my Github.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;vectorized-code&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vectorized Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of R is using logical tests, subsetting, and element-wise execution to speed up code. We can vectorize loops to make them run faster. Here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;abs_loop &amp;lt;- function(vec){
  for (i in 1:length(vec)) {
    if (vec[i] &amp;lt; 0) {
      vec[i] &amp;lt;- -vec[i]
    }
  }
  vec
}

abs_vectorized &amp;lt;- function(vec){
  negs &amp;lt;- vec &amp;lt; 0
  vec[negs] &amp;lt;- vec[negs] * -1
  vec
}

long &amp;lt;- rep(c(-1, 1), 5000000)

system.time(abs_loop(long))
##    user  system elapsed 
##   0.620   0.025   0.654

system.time(abs_vectorized(long))
##    user  system elapsed 
##   0.251   0.047   0.311&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we time the execution, the vectorized function is &lt;strong&gt;much&lt;/strong&gt; faster. These results get amplified at scale!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;version-control&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Version Control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After learning about working with base R, we went into a few week long exploration into version control using Git, Github, and RMarkdown to present results. I do not feel qualified to try and explain Git and Github: although I am comfortable with them, I find it difficult to explain, especially through written text. The course resource we is &lt;a href=&#34;https://happygitwithr.com/&#34;&gt;linked here&lt;/a&gt;, and I believe presents one of the best overviews of integrating Git and Github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I was experienced with Git and Github before coming into this class and have a lot of material, both in R and Python, on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Jonathan-Bonaguro&#34;&gt;my Github Page.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;r-markdown-and-blogdown&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;R Markdown and &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we covered creating useful reports with integrated code using R Markdown, which allows us to create formatted reports with integrated code that are easy to present and share with colleagues. This document that you are currently reading was completely written and formatted in R Markdown! For a great overview and tutorial, please see &lt;a href=&#34;https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/stat3202-sp19//lab/lab-01-assign.html&#34;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://daviddalpiaz.org/&#34;&gt;Professor David Dalpiaz&lt;/a&gt;. It is a great introduction to using R Markdown to integrate code and format reports!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This entir website is created using an R package called &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt;. It allows for the creation of formatted websites using Hugo packages and modifications. It is incredibly powerful, but slightly complicated. Once you are familiar with the system, however, you are able to build fantastic personal and project websites.

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-the-cline-center&#34;&gt;What is the Cline Center?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges that data scientists, social scientists and humanists face is harnessing the power of raw data. The Cline Center for Advanced Social Research is positioned to expand your research capacities, giving voice to data by providing you with powerful tools to analyze it.
We’re based at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s prominent computer and information science hubs and home to the National Center for Supercomputing Applications as well as one of the world’s leading engineering colleges. Working alongside major players in the Big Data ecosystem, we mine a wealth of outstanding information assets to help you solve the world’s most pressing problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cline Center creates and makes available data derived from raw news sources from around the world. By connecting with data scientists and engineering disciplines, the center works to create structured data to improve understanding of issues such as conflict, democratic processes, and identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find out more detailed by visiting &lt;a href=&#34;https://clinecenter.illinois.edu/&#34;&gt;the Cline Center&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-role-at-the-cline-center&#34;&gt;My Role at the Cline Center&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent two years working as both an intern and now an analyst at the Cline Center. My first two semesters, I worked as an intern on the Coup d&#39;État project while undertaking independent study courses under Professor &lt;a href=&#34;https://clinecenter.illinois.edu/people/salthaus&#34;&gt;Scott Althaus&lt;/a&gt; and working with Joseph Bajjalieh and Buddy Peyton, two members of the Data Analytics and Management team. After the first year, I moved into the role of a part time analysis, and have helped facilitate the expansion of the Coup d&#39;État project as well as working on improving the Cline Center&amp;rsquo;s event coding capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;independent-study-courses&#34;&gt;Independent Study Courses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While working as an intern, I worked at the Center ten hours a week and on top of this work undertook individual study courses on data analysis, visualization, and collaboration in a research lab setting. Both semesters culminated in a capstone paper utilizing Cline Center data in a quantitative reserach paper. I submitted proposals, formulated hypotheses, and conducted the analysis which gave me a solid understanding of the research process. My papers looked at the effect of IMF Loan programs on coup outcomes and the effect of interstate wars on coup outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/blog/photography/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;everyone-has-a-hidden-talent-most-people-dont-know-that-i-work-as-a-freelance-photographer&#34;&gt;Everyone has a hidden talent. Most people don&amp;rsquo;t know that I work as a freelance photographer.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve shot headshots, concerts, weddings, and studio portraits. For newspapers, I&amp;rsquo;ve covered sports, feature stories, and breaking news. I spent the summer in 2019 traveling across the country with The Cavaliers Drum &amp;amp; Bugle Corps documenting the life of one of the nations most storied and successful drum corps. I&amp;rsquo;ve done a little bit of it all, and I hope to keep expanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-brief-timeline&#34;&gt;A brief timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents got me my first camera for Christmas in 2015. I had asked for one after experimenting with my parent&amp;rsquo;s Canon Rebel t1i. I thought I would use it a lot, and like a lot of things we try, it turns out I never did. My little Canon 70D sat in a closet for a couple years until the spring of 2018 when a good friend of mine asked me to cover some baseball games for a blog he wrote. My first baseball game was cold and rainy, and I bundled up tight and stuck my camera in a plastic bag to try and protect it. Since that first game, photography has become an integral part of my life and I love the ability to share everyone&amp;rsquo;s story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the first year shooting sports casually for that same blog. At the end of my Junior year of college, I was asked to take over the sports photography department at the campus paper, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dailyillini.com/&#34;&gt;The Daily Illini&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after, I was asked by the director of the Marching Illini to take over as his Media &amp;amp; Public Relations manager for the 2020 season, serving both as principal photographer and head of media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-ive-done&#34;&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;ve done&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;editorial&#34;&gt;Editorial&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sports photography is my primary passion. I love the energy and excitement that comes with shooting sports. The challenge of capturing the perfect moment in the heat of the moment is one that every photographer aspires to. For various outlets, I have covered pretty much every collegiate sports including football, basektball, volleyball, baseball, softball, and cross country. I provide high quality, captioned images on tight deadlines to meet the needs of online and print newspapers. I&amp;rsquo;ve covered sports for blogs like The Champaign Room as well as newspapers such as The Daily Illini and The News-Gazette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although not as frequently, I also cover other editorial photography. I have worked with reporters on feature stories as well as covering breaking news in both Champaign-Urbana and back in my hometown of Naperville, Illinois. Being able to capture images that tell a compelling story of the way the world is and what is going on is my goal. I want readers to be able to feel like they were at an event by conveying strong emotions through my images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;pageantry-arts&#34;&gt;Pageantry Arts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a band nerd all my life, I also have a lot of experience shooting bands. After spending three years in the nation&amp;rsquo;s premier college marching band, the Marching Illini, I served as their photographer for the 2020 season. This included spending all of their preseason camp documenting the journey of prospective members, spending game-days documenting the experience of the band from 7:00am rehearsals all the way through their post game concert. I was with them for many events including the Homecoming Parade and Concert, MI in Concert, and the Redbox Bowl in Santa Clara, California. My experience as a performer made me a natural fit for the band, as I took that experience and turned it into my images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the summer of 2019 travling with The Cavaliers Drum &amp;amp; Bugle Corps as their chief photographer. With a team of two other photographers, I set the creative direction of a team that captured dynamic and captivating images for promotional and social media use for a ~$5 million dollar non-profit organization. I told the corps story by becoming nearly an integrated member of the corps. We traveled by tour buses late at night and slept in high school gyms and classrooms. Every day from late May through early August I was telling the story of competitive marching arts through captivating imagry, and I learned a lot about working with a creative team and how to manage and learn from and incorporate feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;miscellaneous&#34;&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like any other photographer, I pride myself on being flexbile. Although my primary work has been in sport and editorial work, I am more than happy to work with anyone on any project! I&amp;rsquo;ve shot portraits, headshots, weddings, and other events. Do you know a person who needs a fresh LinkedIn picture or just some more recent shots? Are you a business lookig to market some products? I&amp;rsquo;m more than happy to talk to you. Visit the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jonathan-bonaguro.github.io/#contact&#34;&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; portion of my website to connect with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;follow-your-passions&#34;&gt;Follow your Passions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love my day job. Working as a researcher in a social science research firm truly is my passion, and I hope someday to earn my Ph. D. and continue work on event data. However, photography will always be a significant portion of my life. Having a hobby that I am passionate about not only makes me a happier, more rounded human being, but I find that it makes me more productive in my day job too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;work-with-me&#34;&gt;Work with me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to see more? I have a limited selection of my work available on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/thewanderingbonaguro/&#34;&gt;Instagram Page&lt;/a&gt;, and I am happy to share more upon request. Again, head over to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://jonathan-bonaguro.github.io/#contact&#34;&gt;contact widget&lt;/a&gt; and connect with me. I hope to have either a dedicated photography website or a more flushed out photography blog on this website soon. Check back soon for updates, and &lt;strong&gt;follow your passions!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Making Friends and Influencing People</title>
      <link>/blog/senior_thesis/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;making-friends-and-influencing-people-the-effect-of-social-media-on-political-knowledge-overconfidence&#34;&gt;Making Friends and Influencing People: The Effect of Social Media on Political Knowledge Overconfidence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 2019-2020 academic year I am undertaking the process of writing a senior thesis. In the fall semester, I took part in a Senior Thesis methodology survey, where the undergraduate honors cohort learned the ins and outs of reserach design and began developing our theses. During the spring semester, I developed my research design and am currently waiting on IRB approval to run my survey. Here&amp;rsquo;s a little bit more information about this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fall-2019&#34;&gt;Fall 2019&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS 495:&lt;/strong&gt; Provides an advanced overview of methodological issues in political science especially identification of research questions and design of research strategies in political science appropriate for a senior thesis. Requires completion of a substantial research proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2019-2020 honors cohort spent the fall of 2019 studying research methods and design under the direction of Professor &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/mswinters1/home&#34;&gt;Matt Winters&lt;/a&gt;. We discussed topics such as the philosophy of science, formulating reserach questions and hypotheses, and the gold standards of reserach design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research focuses on the effect of social media networks on political knowledge overconfidence. Do our friends inadvertently cause us to think we know more than we do? Although more and more people say that they are using Facebook to gather news, &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;most users find news while on Facebook for other reasons and don&amp;rsquo;t actually follow a news organization.&lt;/a&gt; It turns out, people see news on Facebook mostly when it is &lt;a href=&#34;10.1177/2053168018816189&#34;&gt;shared by their friends.&lt;/a&gt; Not only do Facebook users mostly see content when it is shared by their friends, the &lt;a href=&#34;10.1111/0022-3816.00033&#34;&gt;friends they trust to share accurate information&lt;/a&gt; can lead a person to be &lt;a href=&#34;10.1177/2053168018816189&#34;&gt;overconfident in their level of political knowledge.&lt;/a&gt; My research asks if the type of friend who shares political news can affect levels of overconfidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spring-2020&#34;&gt;Spring 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of this process, we were asked to locate advisors for our thesis. My advisor is Professor &lt;a href=&#34;https://clinecenter.illinois.edu/people/salthaus&#34;&gt;Scott Althaus&lt;/a&gt;, who&amp;rsquo;s research focuses on political communication. With his guidance, I designed an experiment to test the effect of classes of friends sharing political content and their effect on levels of political knowledge. This reserach is ongoing, and the final thesis will be available in early May. My reserach has also been accepted for presentation at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://undergradresearch.illinois.edu/symposium.html&#34;&gt;Illinois Undergraduate Research Symposium&lt;/a&gt; where I will be presenting a post on April 30, 2020 in the Illini Union. Please reach out before then if you have any questions about my reserach by visiting my &lt;a href=&#34;https://jonathan-bonaguro.github.io/#contact&#34;&gt;contact widget.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
